NOTES
======

Is it possible to attribute software projects to a country/nation, when obviously for most projects, contributors are spread over the world?

For the purpose of this map, we will attribute projects to countries in two cases:

1) There is a legal entity that is in charge of the development and management. In that case, the legal entity (foundation, or similar) has a physical location.
2) There is a clear project leader.

List of proposals:

## France:

* VLC - VideoLAN is an organization based in France. http://www.videolan.org/legal.html

## Germany

## Italy

## Netherlands

* Blender: Stichting Blender Foundation http://www.blender.org/blenderorg/blender-foundation/

## Poland
