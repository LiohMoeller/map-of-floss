NOTES
======

Is it possible to attribute software projects to a country/nation, when obviously for most projects, contributors are spread over the world?

For the purpose of this map, we will attribute projects to countries in two cases:

1) There is a legal entity that is in charge of the development and management. In that case, the legal entity (foundation, or similar) has a physical location.  
2) There is a clear project leader.
