A Map of Free/Libre/Open-Source Software in Europe
==========================

The objective of this project is to establish a European map that depicts the biggest european FLOSS projects.

## The rules:

* One project per country.
* If there are several contenders, choose the biggest, most well known, most important project.

## Background
This idea emerged spontaneously during a discussion between Julien Deswaef and Manuel Schmalstieg, during LGM 2013, in Madrid.
